# Snake, Water, Gun Game
This is a simple JavaScript implementation of the classic game "Snake, Water, Gun." The game prompts the user to enter 'S' for Snake, 'W' for Water, or 'G' for Gun, and the computer randomly generates its own choice. The outcome of each round (Win, Loss, or Draw) is determined and displayed using alerts, and the user is asked if they want to continue playing. Scores are tracked and displayed after each round.

## Rules
- Snake (S) drinks Water (W)
